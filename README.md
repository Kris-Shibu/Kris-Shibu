What is a keylogger?
A keylogger is a light but nifty piece of spyware
that attackers use to record keystrokes the user
types on his device.

# FTP  Banner grabber in Python
Webservers have banners, this program, using the FTP protocol  will grab the banner of the webserver.  
The banner would contain information about the version of the webserver and the various other services it is running.  
The attacker can then use this to find exploits for the services the webserver is running.
